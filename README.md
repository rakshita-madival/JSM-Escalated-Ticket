# üöÄ Jira Service Management - Escalated Tickets

## üìë Overview
This repository showcases escalated ticket examples handled in **Jira Service Management (JSM)** as part of my IT Support practice. It demonstrates how I manage IT support tickets that require escalation beyond Level 1 and Level 2 troubleshooting.

Each ticket represents a real-world scenario where I perform structured troubleshooting, determine when escalation is necessary, communicate with users, and follow proper ticket lifecycle processes.

# üî• Ticket Example: Office Wi-Fi Network Issue (Escalated)

## üÜò Incident Description
- **Issue:** Unable to connect to the office Wi-Fi network.
- **Impact:** Multiple users were affected, indicating a network-wide issue beyond an individual device.
- **Ticket Type:** Incident / Service Request
- **Priority:** High

---

## üéØ Objective
- Diagnose whether the issue is device-related or infrastructure-related.
- Perform all possible Level 1 and Level 2 troubleshooting steps.
- Escalate appropriately when the issue is beyond Level 2 scope.
- Communicate professionally with the customer.
- Document the entire process, both publicly (user-facing) and internally (agent-facing).

## üîç Troubleshooting Summary
| Step | Action                                     | Result                                   |
|------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ   | Checked Wi-Fi adapter on user device       | Working correctly                         |
| ‚úÖ   | Verified IP and network settings           | No issues found                           |
| ‚úÖ   | Restarted network adapter                  | Issue persisted                            |
| ‚úÖ   | Tested connectivity to other networks      | Failed (on office Wi-Fi)                  |
| ‚úÖ   | Asked other users about the issue          | Multiple users reported same problem      |
| ‚úÖ   | Checked physical network infrastructure    | Identified it as beyond Level 2 scope     |

---

## üö© Escalation Reason
> After confirming that the issue was not device-specific and affected multiple users, the root cause was identified as a network infrastructure issue (likely the Wi-Fi router or access point). The ticket was escalated to the **Network Support Team** for further investigation and resolution.
